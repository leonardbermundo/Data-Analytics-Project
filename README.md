# Data Analytics Project: Increasing an NBA team's odds of winning a championship by analyzing data from the last 19 NBA seasons

For this data analytics project, I have selected to create an analysis using SQL and Tableau, on how to increase the teamâ€™s odds of winning the NBA championship from the data from the last 19 NBA seasons. To answer key business questions, I followed the six phases of data analysis according to Google: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

Detailed documentation of SQL scripts is available on GitHub.
Data cleaning and exploration are performed using Microsoft SQL Server.
Data visualization is presented using Tableau Public.
